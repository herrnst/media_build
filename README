This was an experimental build system for media drivers, allowing media drivers
from mainline to be backported to older kernels.

However, to maintain this took too much time and effort for little gain. Few
if any new PCI(e) or USB drivers have been added to mainline in a long time,
almost all effort is happening for embedded systems.

In addition, it was only compile tested, and not whether it would actually work.

So the decision was made to stop maintaining this.

If someone would want to take over maintainership, then post a message to the
linux-media@vger.kernel.org mailinglist.
